# Pathfinding Visualizer
Try the visualizing tool here: https://myril283.github.io/pathfinding_visualizer/

Features-
1. It finds the shortest path from the starting point to the ending point.
2. Real-time visualization of the pathfinding algorithms
3. The position of the starting and ending points can be changed by dragging them.
4. You can draw on the grid to put obstacles.
5. You can choose from these algorithms:
   
    (i) Dijkstra's algorithm and Breadth-First Search (BFS): finds the shortest path
   
    (ii) Depth-First Search (DFS) does not necessarily find the shortest path

6. Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
